# Python Singleton Factory Pattern

As I develop backend server using fastAPI framework, I felt that python based frameworks are so fast and light.<br>
So they are very easily learnable and have a good productivity.<br><br>
However, that advantages sometimes get into some kinds of disadvantages.<br><br>

I usually develop using spring boot framework, so I am familiar with object oriented programming and various design patterns that help to implement OOP.<br>
Because python based frameworks are so light, they delegate many responsibilities to developer.<br><br>
From creation of instances to management, they are all developers' responsibilities.<br><br>
I am thinking spring boot's object management policies(bean factory, dependency injection, singleton pattern.. etc) are well structured, so I decided to cast some useful concepts of spring boot to python.<br><br>

Important point I think is implementing spring's core concepts, but not to be overenginnering.<br>
Because by spending so much time in making spring-like environment, it will be more likely to miss the advantages of python based framework.<br><br>
Below is what I try to implement :
1. Instances Creation and Management (Spring Container in Spring Framework)
2. Dependency Injection
3. Singleton Pattern
